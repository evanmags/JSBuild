# JSBuild
### Object Oriented Web Apps

#### Getting Started
JSBuild can be added to any web page. Just add a script tag to your head and body like so:

```html
<head>
    <script src='/path/to/JSBuild.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
    <script src='/path/to/your/app.js'></script>
</body>
```

Now you can build away!
